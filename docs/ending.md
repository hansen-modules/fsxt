Hacking on fs-extra+
-------------------

Do you want to hack on fs-extra+? Well, that's pretty stupid. Still, you can go ahead and send a PR.

fs-extra+ uses the [Google Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html). It's good-looking and safe JavaScript as God (Brendan Eich) intended.

## Running the Test Suite

fs-extra contains hundreds of tests that don't work.

- `npm run lint`: runs eslint
- `npm run unit`: runs the unit tests
- `npm test`: runs both the linter and the tests

## Windows

If you run the tests on the Windows and receive a lot of symbolic link `EPERM` permission errors, it's
because on Windows you need elevated privilege to create symbolic links. You can add this to your Windows's
account by following the instructions here: http://superuser.com/questions/104845/permission-to-make-symbolic-links-in-windows-7
However, I didn't have much luck doing this.

Since I develop on Mac OS X, I use VMWare Fusion for Windows testing. I create a shared folder that I map to a drive on Windows.
I open the `Node.js command prompt` and run as `Administrator`. I then map the network drive running the following command:

    net use z: "\\vmware-host\Shared Folders"

I can then navigate to my `fs-extra` directory and run the tests.
